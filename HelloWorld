# include <iostream> 
// This tells the preprocessor to include the header file "iostream" in the program.
// iostream is the header file responsable for input and output streams. It 
// contains functions like cin and cout.

// # include <string>

// The data type 'string' is a programmer-defined type and is not part of the C++
// language; however the C++ standard library supplies it. 

using namespace std;

// It is known that “std” (abbreviation for the standard) is a namespace whose members are used in the program. 
// So the members of the “std” namespace are cout, cin, endl, etc. This namespace is present in the iostream.

int main()		// This is the main function and serves as an entry point for the program.
{
	string x = "Hello World!";	
  // Here we define a variable, x, as a string and initializes 
  // x to "Hello World!". 

	cout << x << endl;		// The variable x is being outputted. 
		
	system("PAUSE");		// The system pauses so we can read our output. 

	return 0; // returns the value of 0 to the operating system when the program terminates 
}
