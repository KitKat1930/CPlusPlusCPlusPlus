# Learning C++ 
This repository will contain information on how to code in the computer programming language of C++!

### I. Download Visual Studio
- In my example, I installed Visual Studio Community version 17.0

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/

### II. Install the Visual Studio installer
- Run the bootstrapper file you downloaded to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual Studio.

- From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper that matches or is similar to one of the following files:

      vs_community.exe for Visual Studio Community
      vs_professional.exe for Visual Studio Professional
      vs_enterprise.exe for Visual Studio Enterprise

### III. After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting the workloads, or feature sets, that you want. Here's how.

- Find the workload you want in the Installing Visual Studio screen.
- For core C and C++ support, choose the "Desktop development with C++" workload. It comes with the default core editor, which includes basic code editing support for over 20 languages, the ability to open and edit code from any folder without requiring a project, and integrated source code control.

### IV. Start Developing!!!
