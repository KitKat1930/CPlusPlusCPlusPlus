# Learning C++ 
This repository will contain information on how to code in the computer programming language of C++!

### Why high-level languages are better than low level programming languages?

The main difference between high level language and low level language is that programmers can easily understand or interpret or compile the high level language in comparison of machine. On the other hand, machines can easily understand the low level language in comparison of human beings.

C++ is considered a low-level programming language. You can write a fairly high-level code, with complicated data structures and local variables and functions and various other things you'd find in "high"-level languages, and still have it translated into 100% pure uninterpreted assembly language.

C++ is also faster than Python because C++ is a compiled language and Python is an interpreted language. 

### I. Download Visual Studio
- In my example, I installed Visual Studio Community version 17.0

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/

### II. Install the Visual Studio installer
- Run the bootstrapper file you downloaded to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual Studio.

- From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper that matches or is similar to one of the following files:

      vs_community.exe for Visual Studio Community
      vs_professional.exe for Visual Studio Professional
      vs_enterprise.exe for Visual Studio Enterprise

### III. After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting the workloads, or feature sets, that you want. Here's how.

- Find the workload you want in the Installing Visual Studio screen.
- For core C and C++ support, choose the "Desktop development with C++" workload. It comes with the default core editor, which includes basic code editing support for over 20 languages, the ability to open and edit code from any folder without requiring a project, and integrated source code control.

### IV. Start Developing!!!
